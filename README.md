## Explanation:
 - [x] server/:
   - [x] app.js: The main entry point of your Express.js application. It initializes the server, sets up middleware, and defines routes.
   - [x] config/:
     - [x] config.js: Stores application-wide configurations (e.g., port number, environment variables).
     - [x] database.js: Handles database connection logic (e.g., connecting to MongoDB).
     - [x] env.js: Loads environment variables (e.g., API keys, database credentials).
   - [x] controllers/: Contains logic for handling HTTP requests and interacting with the database. Each controller is responsible for a specific set of actions (e.g., create product, get user details).
   - [x] models/: Defines the schema for your MongoDB documents. Each model represents a collection in the database.
   - [x] routes/: Defines the routes for different parts of your application. Each route file maps HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to controller functions.
   - [x] middleware/: Contains reusable functions that can be applied to requests or responses (e.g., authentication middleware, error handling middleware).
   - [x] services/: Contains business logic that is not directly related to HTTP requests (e.g., email sending, payment processing).
   - [x] utils/: Contains helper functions for common tasks (e.g., data validation, string manipulation).
   - [x] bin/www.js: The script that starts the server.
 - [x] package.json:
   - [x] Contains metadata about your project, such as dependencies, scripts, and author information.
## Key Principles:
 - [x] Organization: A well-organized folder structure improves code readability, maintainability, and collaboration.
 - [x] Separation of Concerns: Separate concerns into different files and folders to improve code modularity and testability.
 - [x] Convention over Configuration: Adhere to common conventions to make your code more predictable and easier to understand for other developers.
This is a basic structure, and you can customize it to fit your specific needs. For example, you might add additional folders for tests, documentation, or logging.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
